# Handong_sciencefair_fishcar_2023_1
This project was for the science fair. I used c language to make a fishlike moving car with Arduino

A current study shows that a boat that moves like fish has more movement efficiency than a boat that only has a propeller on its back. There are certain differences between water and air, but it is an undeniable fact that they both are following fluid mechanics. So it would cause great efficiency for the vehicle on the land that follows the fish's movement.
So I tested out with the car that has a fish shape and fish movement, and the result said it actually increased the efficiency(speed) of the car.


# My hypothesis was:
# 1. Applying a fish shape to a car will increase the car's speed by controlling the wind's resistance. 
# 2. Moving the side motor left and right, like fish, will increase the speed of a car
